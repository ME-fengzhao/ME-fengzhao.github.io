</blockquote>
<h3 id="introduction">1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Compliant mechanisms (CMs) are designed to achieve transfer or
transformation of motion, force, or energy through elastic deformation
of flexible elements.</p>
<p>CMs have gained significant attention in the last few decades as they
offer many advantages over traditional rigid-body mechanisms. A CM has
monolithic structure, which reduces the number of assembly steps, thus
simplifying the fabrication process and requiring reduced maintenance.
High precision is attained, and the need for lubrication (润滑) is
eliminated due to the absence of contact among members that causes wear,
friction, backlash, and noise.</p>
<p>The structural compliance integrated in the main body of a device is
exploited to perform object manipulation tasks such as grasping (抓取),
cutting(切割), retracting(拉回), and suturing(缝合) for surgical
procedures in the form of ablation(消融), laparoscopy(腹腔镜检查),
endoscopy(内窥镜检查), and biopsy (活检), to mention a few. CMs also
serve a secondary function in the device to transmit force/motion. Force
sensing using CMs to monitor tool–tissue interaction has also been
demonstrated, which serves as a feedback for safe operation of the
device inside the human body.</p>
<p>This article aims to provide an overview of this process, which
involves five major aspects involves five major aspects: <strong>(i) CM
conceptual design and synthesis, (ii) analysis, (iii) material
selection, (iv) fabrication methods, and (v) actuation methods</strong>.
Furthermore, this article also reviews the existing literature on
surgical devices that use CMs by classification into five major groups:
<strong>(i) grasping and cutting, (ii) reachability and steerability,
(iii) transmission, (iv) sensing, and (v) implants and deployable
devices (植入物与可展开装置)</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="design-aspects">2 Design Aspects</h3>
<p>Four techniques used in the synthesis of CMs: <strong>freedom and
constraint topologies (FACTs)</strong>, <strong>building
blocks</strong>, <strong>topology optimization</strong>, and
<strong>rigid-body replacement</strong>.</p>
<p>However, many compliant surgical devices are designed without
explicit use of these conventional synthesis methods. <strong>This may
be because the synthesis methods developed for CMs mostly apply to
input-output transmission characteristics rather than guiding and
maneuvering</strong>. The scope of the expected functions of surgical
devices, described later in the article, offers a huge opportunity for
designers.</p>

<p>From a clinical standpoint, other criteria that need to be considered
are the biocompatibility (生物相容性), chemical resistance (耐化学性),
elasticity (弹性), transparency (透明性), strength (强度), temperature
resistance (温度耐性), and most importantly, sterilizability (灭菌性) of
the chosen material.</p>
<p>The method of actuation is an important aspect to be considered in
the design of a CM. Cable-driven actuation is the most widely used
method among continuum manipulators and steerable instruments. SMAs and
piezoelectric materials are seen more in high precision devices and for
micro/nano manipulation. While fluidic actuation is used in a few
flexible surgical instruments, there is a gradual increase toward the
use of magnetic actuation in designing surgical devices for precise
contactless control.</p>

<h3 id="surgical-applications">3 Surgical Applications</h3>
<h4 id="grasping-and-cutting">3.1 Grasping and Cutting</h4>
<p>CMs have been used to develop forceps (手术钳), scissors (剪刀),
graspers, and needle holders for performing different surgical tasks
such as grasping, cutting, suturing (缝合), and holding tissue.</p>
<p>Several forms of grasping tools have been investigated, which utilize
the flexibility and stiffness that a CM can offer with different
geometry, materials, and fabrication techniques.</p>
<p>The introduction of robot-assisted surgery has led to many designs of
CM-based grasping end effectors, to deliver efficient manipulation with
high dexterity.</p>
<p>The monolithic nature of CMs makes them easier to fabricate when
compared to the pivoted jaw configurations of current grasping tools.
Hence, CM was used in developing a <strong>disposable</strong> compliant
forceps for HIV patients in which, the Q-joints methods was employed to
replace a conventional pin-joint.</p>
<p>At micrometer scale, CM-based microgrippers and micromanipulators
have been developed based on flexure hinges and cantilever beam
structures. While the use of CMs contributes to the elimination of
Coulomb friction and backlash, they have some inherent drawbacks. As
noted in the design of a low cost flexure-based hand-held mechanism for
micromanipulation, <strong>a drift in the major axis is caused by the
imperfect rotation of most compliant joints</strong>. Flexure hinges
have limited range of angular motion depending on the geometry and
material properties of the hinge, and cantilever structures fail to
produce perfect <strong>parallel motion</strong>. However, topology
optimization aided by intuition has been used to design CM grippers with
parallel-jaw motion.</p>
<h4 id="reachability-and-steerability">3.2 Reachability and
Steerability</h4>
<p>This section describes applications of CMs to increase the range of
motion and enhance steerability of the surgical instruments to reach
difficult to reach surgical sites inside the body.</p>
<p>Continuum manipulators are devices that can be precisely steered
inside the body to reach difficult-to-access surgical sites. CMs have
been used to design flexible miniaturized continuum manipulators for
robot-assisted surgery. A similar design was used in a flexible micro
manipulator for <strong>neurosurgery</strong>.</p>
<p>Notched-tube compliant joint mechanisms are variants of
aforementioned continuum manipulators, where different shapes, sizes,
and patterns of notches made on tubes can enable different DoFs and
range of motion.</p>
<p>Concentric tube robots (CTRs, 同心管机器人) are a special type of
continuum manipulators that are made of multiple precurved elastic tubes
that are concentrically nested within one another. CTRs have been
deployed for “follow-the-leader” insertion, and their steering is not
affected by the tissue interaction forces. Thus, they have found several
applications as steerable needles and miniaturized surgical
manipulators.</p>
<h4 id="transmission">3.3 Transmission</h4>
<p>Transmission refers to the use of CMs in augmenting an actuator in
the transfer of force, displacement, or energy. In some surgical
devices, CMs made for force or displacement transmission serve as an
input or feedback for the principal function of the device. Lan and Wang
developed an adjustable constant-force forceps for robot-assisted
surgical manipulation to aid in grasping soft tissues. It employs a
compliant constant-torque mechanism made using flexible arms to transmit
the required force to forceps tips. The motion of a flexure-based
parallel manipulator for an active hand-held micro-surgical instrument
was tracked to cancel the hand tremors (颤抖) using piezo-actuators.</p>
<p>A drawback of CMs is that energy efficiency is challenged due to
energy storage in the flexible members of the mechanism.</p>
<h4 id="sensing">3.4 Sensing</h4>
<p>Sensing application refers to the use of CMs in detecting or
measuring physical quantities. Several kinds of sensors rely on the
change in deflection or stiffness of CMs in conjunction with other
transducers like optical sensors and strain gauges to measure physical
parameters. Alternatively, vision-based force sensing integrated with
miniature grippers was reported by Reddy et al.. Subsequently, a
compliant end-effector to passively limit the force in tele-operated
tissue-cutting using the vision based force sensing for haptic feedback
was demonstrated.</p>
<p>Force sensing forms an integral part of different surgical
applications that involve tissue palpation (触诊), pulling, and pushing
of tissue during biopsy (活检), to name a few.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible force sensors, in
particular, benefit from a CM-based design as the metallic and electric
elements (金属和电器元件) can be placed outside MRI. The force sensing
element typically consists of an elastic body which deforms under the
influence of an applied force, which in turn is measured by a transducer
like <strong>optical fiber</strong>.</p>
<p>Achallenge with multi-axial force sensors lies in the decoupling of
forces along the axes. Linear decoupling methods proved to be inaccurate
since local deformation of flexures affects the strains measured. A
method to decouple pulling and grasping forces of a 2DOF compliant
forceps was derived using the serial connections of two torsional
springs, which was realized by optimizing the shape of two circular-type
flexure hinges.</p>
<p>Other factors to be considered while designing force sensors include
thermal sensitivity, hysteresis, plastic deformation and friction due to
contact between internal components that can alter the elastic behavior
of flexures.</p>
<h4 id="implants-and-deployable-devices">3.5 Implants and Deployable
Devices</h4>
<p>Implants are medical devices embedded inside the body via surgery to
replace or enhance damaged biological tissue. Within the context of this
article, deployable devices refer to CMs designed to change in shape and
size that facilitate insertion of the surgical device in a compact form
to reduce invasiveness of the procedure. Origami works well with
flexible nonmetallic materials, thus making them ideal for MRI-guided
procedures, which is hazardous in the presence of magnetic
materials.</p>

<p>This study began with the aim of assessing the utility of CMs in
designing surgical devices. There are some challenges that hinder the
further development and implementation of these devices in clinical
practice. A drawback concerning CMs is the <strong>adverse effect of
stress concentrations and fatigue, especially in flexure-based designs
under cyclic loading</strong>. This is a major challenge in the medical
field where device failure is not acceptable. To tackle this issue,
there is a growing interest towards developing multi-material CMs and
functional grading of CMs to enhance structural integrity. Soft robotics
is another emerging field of interest, which utilizes flexibility to
function but is not classified under CMs. Inspired by the softness and
body compliance of biological systems, continuum devices based on soft
robotics systems are designed using compliant materials.</p>
<p>The behavior of CMs with geometric <strong>nonlinearity caused by
large deflections</strong> is disregarded in many studies. There is
scope for improvement by analyzing and understanding the deformation of
flexible members of CMs under these complex conditions.</p>
<p>This review highlights the merits of CMs over conventional rigid body
mechanisms due to elimination of joint friction, backlash, wear, and
need for lubrication. This aspect is leveraged by integration of CMs
with modern actuators such as magnets, SMAs, and piezoelectric
materials.</p>
<p>However, a major challenge lies in analyzing an overall system of CM
consisting of multiple flexible members. While the monolithic nature of
most of the CMs simplifies the fabrication and assembly processes, the
flip side is that the whole design may fail if even one part of the
mechanism breaks.</p>
<p>From a clinical standpoint, the protection of instruments from
contamination due to contact with fluids is important. As a potential
solution, some researchers have suggested soft elastic coating of the
instrument. However, further analysis of the implications of in-vivo
operating conditions on the instrument’s performance, while maintaining
sterilization, is necessary.</p>
